        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light">Residents have reported a series of sightings involving an ominous figure throughout the 
            local area. What has been stumping people, however, is the way in which this mysterious entity has been observed. An alarmingly 
            high number of reports in recent days have come forward, detailing stickers, posters, and even coffee mugs portraying the figure. 
            While the exact nature of the figure remains unclear, these unexplained sightings have sparked curiosity and concern among locals. 
            SYS News is here to break the story hot off the press. 
            <br><br>

        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light"><br><br></h3>
        <h2 class="degular-subhead">THE UNSEEN HAND<br>THAT BROUGHT US HERE</h2>
        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light"><br><br></h3>

        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light">The first report came in four days ago, from an art student who was on their morning jog as 
            part of their daily routine. The student, who asked to remain anonymous, recounts how taken aback they were at the sight of the figure.
            <em>"I'm used to pretty absurdist art, but this was nothing like that."</em> They found an alarming number of posters, stickers, and flyers
            plastered alongside traffic posts and mailboxes, all depicting the creepy figure. Though there was no immediate danger, the situation
            was unsettling enough for the student to notify a nearby officer.
            <br><br>
            And that's probably the most normal sighting regarding the figure. In the coming days, sightings of the figure in the most bizarre locations
            continued to pop up. Various locals gave reports of mugs, pins, even water bottles depicting the figureâ€“ all items that require mass manufacturing. 
            The fact that these all appeared in high volume only recently have led many to the conclusion that this was a premeditated stunt. Even a billboard 
            was spotted displaying the figure, before being taken down almost instantly. Those who caught a glimpse of it speculate whether it was
            intentional or a potential hijacking.
            <br><br>
            One store owner even had some of her merchandising replaced throughout the night. She arrived to work in the morning, only to find some of her sweaters
            and tote bags replaced with screenprintings of the figure. Although distressed at first, the popularity of the figure has led people and news stations
            to flock over to her store, generating her profit and publicity. <em>"It's creepy, but it isn't exactly harming me... it's actually been pretty 
            good for business."</em> As much as she appreciates the stunt now, though, she still expresses confusion about the whole thing. <em>"I'd still
            like some sort of explanation."</em>

        <h2 class="degular-subhead">SECRECY IS INCREDIBLY<br>IMPORTANT TO THEM<br></h2>
        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light"><br><br></h3>
    
        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light">The question on everyone's minds is: just <em>who</em> exactly is the figure in these photos? 
            Unfortunately, most attempts to try to solve this have proven to be futile. The photos are too warped to unedit it through special software, 
            and reverse image searching have yielded no results. What's most perplexing is that each sighting of the figure differs from the other. 
            While every figure generally retains the same prominent feature, each slightly deviates in a minor way, such as being stretched vertically 
            or warped diagonally ever so slightly.
            <br><br>
            Due to these inconsistencies, it is possible that people unaffiliated with the initial movement are now contributing to the phenomenon themselves.
            It might now become a matter of trying to distinguish all these "phonies" from the original figure. Whether or not this was an intended factor of the stunt
            is still unknown.
            <br><br>
            People have questioned not only the identity of figure, but also the artist behind the entire scheme. Many have theorized it to be a publicity for 
            an upcoming movie or TV show, but this explanation isn't satisfactory for most people. Some even jokingly refer to it as Banksy's next piece. Whatever the
            case may be, the artist remains just as elusive as the figure itself. No such insignia or signature has been found on the various hundreds of pieces observed,
            so it appears as though the artist wishes to remain anonymous as well. The entire situation has left the community perplexed, with not only a mystery 
            figure but a mystery artist pulling the strings. With the massive recognition this stunt has already garnered, though, it's only a matter of time before
            people start to connect dots and link it back to someone.

        <h2 class="degular-subhead">PERCEPTION IS A<br>REFLECTION OF YOURSELF<br></h2>
        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light"><br><br></h3>

        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light"> The community's response to the stunt has certainly been interesting. Some individuals have engaged with the pieces, 
            claiming to know the user's true identity. On social media, one user jokingly writes, <em>"im voting for [REDACTED] this upcoming election."</em> Another 
            user states, <em>"50 likes and ill do a face reveal of [REDACTED]."</em> REDACTED, of course, refers to the identity these users are claiming belong to the 
            figure. As these claims remain unfounded from random people on the internet, the suggested identities of the figure have been withheld unless proven to be
            true later on.
            <br><br>
            The general consensus seems to be that the stunt is pretty unnerving. However, some have gone on to commend the stunt for its execution and effectiveness.
            One person tells us, <em>"You gotta admit, it takes a lot of preparation for someone to pull off something this big. If it really was just one person behind
            this, hats off to them."</em> Another person has stated, <em>"I'm just glad it's not some rich snob trying to sell it off for millions. Art's gotten
            so elitist these days."</em> Perhaps the funniest of these interviews were a group of skaters who decked out their boards in stickers containing the figure.
            When we asked why, they said, <em>"Street art's the purest form of art!"</em>
            <br><br>
            But some have brushed off the whole incident, even criticizing the backlash and reaction that the figure has received. <em>"Pop culture has manipulated our 
            perception of art,"</em> said one bystander that we interviewed. <em>"You have people lining up for hours at the Louvre to see some small portrait, but when 
            there's some artwork outside a museum, now we start complaining?"</em> And there's some genuine merit to that argument. What difference does it make for artwork 
            to be displayed in a museum gallery versus the streets? Many have said that artwork is devalued the moment it leaves the gallery walls.

        <h2 class="degular-subhead">EXPLANATION LOST<br>IN TRANSLATION</h2>
        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light"><br><br></h3>

        <h3 class="cormorant-garamond-light">Experts in paranormal phenomena and psychology have weighed in with some theories behind these sightings. They 
            speculate that the sightings are a result of a mass psychological phenomenon, caused by potential anxiety or stress. It is possible
            that the craze has led to some people only "imagining" that they saw the figure, when in reality their own subconscious played a trick on them.
            Or, some people may be providing false reports as a way to hop on a bandwagon and feel as though they're part of the stunt.
            <br><br>
            But what's more, the intention of the artist still goes unexplained. At the time of writing, there appears to be no ulterior motive behind the stunt;
            there's no criticism of a current event, no attempt at monetary gain, not even an attempt to promote their own name. It is simply just thatâ€“ a silhouetted
            figure. Perhaps in the coming days, the next piece of the puzzle may be uncovered to us... if we're even <em>meant</em> to view it as a puzzle. 
            <br><br>
            The lack of a definitive answer has sparked discussion of when art crosses the line between admirable and threatening. Some continue to applaud the 
            work, while others have made a call to remove the figures from outside. While some have travelled to see the figures in person, others in the community
            have tried distancing themselves from it as much as possible. At this point, <em>would</em> an explanation even be enough to change people's minds? Is
            any sort of justification able to sway the consensus positively or negatively? Whatever the case may be, much of the community anticipates the figure's
            next moveâ€“ for better or for worse.
