        This harmonic collection is an archive of the various different stickers I've come across and documented in New York City.
        <br><br>
        Having grown up in Queens and Brookyln, graffiti stickers have been a prominent part of my life. They're something that I've passed by countless times on my walks to school, and something that's influenced my current tastes and design aesthetics. I wish to use this collection to pay homage to that art form, and to
        show others the beauty that form can hold.
        <br><br>
        Each entry is based on the sticker I documented for that week, and reinterpreted to take advantage of the digital interface I'm working with. Whether it be for 
        its aeshtetics, fonts, or overall message, each entry is meant to vary from one another. Like the stickers it pulls its inpiration from, they each carry an identity of its own, unique to itself and able to stand on its own. To document the original sticker as well, each icon has been referenced and redrawn by me digitally.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to start a conversation of what art is and isn't worthy of our attention. We pass by these street stickers every day, yet rarely do they leave a lasting
        impression on us; even I find myself guilty of that sometimes. But in an otherwise hectic city, they can be a quick flash of color, not found within gallery walls but placed unsuspectingly in our commutes. Stopping for just a moment, or noting it down, can be the start of something beautiful. Each and every art form can inspire us to make something amazing, and that is what I aim to demonstrate in this website â€“ through graffiti stickers.
        <br><br>
        You are free to explore this site however you like; play with it, be curious about it, try to destroy it even. Whatever the case may be, I hope that you are able
        to discover something new or surprising.
